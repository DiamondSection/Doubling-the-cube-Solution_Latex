# The solution to the doubling the cube problem.

Notice: I know that the problem is impossible to solve in the standard way - by solving the Quadratic Equation. It's an axiom. 
What I mean here is that I have found a solution that allows us to get the cube root of 2 with any given accuracy. 
You say the accuracy (e.g. 10^-15, 10^-25, 10^-55,) 
- I construct a segment whose the length is equal to the cube root of 2 with an accuracy of 10^-15, 10^-25, 10^-55... e.t.c. No matter, one's can construct on demand any decimal "tail".
